## IP/MPLS over Optical Networks

This book about “IP/MPLS over optical networks” is for any networking professional, who is working in the communication industry, and has already acquired a great knowledge of computer networking technologies.

It aims, when we need it, to refresh our memories from time to time about the very essentials of optical and Internet technologies which are becoming fundamental to our communication systems.

You can download it from the “Latest Thinking” section from my blog: asiliconvalleyinsider.com.

As the architecture of the Internet has evolved, I will update that book in the future in particular with a section on Software Defined Networks (SDN).
